# Our Place - Digital Apartment

A cozy digital apartment for long-distance couples to connect, share memories, and plan for the future.

## About The Project

This project is a web application built with React and Supabase, designed to be a shared "Digital Apartment" for two users. It aims to provide a single, cohesive space with various interactive "rooms" and features to help bridge the distance in a long-distance relationship.

## Features

The application is structured around a central "room" from which users can access different features:

- **The Digital Fridge:** A real-time, drag-and-drop canvas for notes and photos.
- **The Relationship RPG (Arcade):** A gamified task tracker with a virtual currency system.
- **The Scrollytelling Timeline:** A vertical, animated timeline of shared memories with an interactive map.
- **The Virtual Living Room:** A synchronized YouTube player for watching videos together.
- **The Window to the Future:** A planner for shared travel and life goals.
- **The Digital Memory Archive (Couch):** A photo gallery and memory archive with image uploads and location tagging.
- **Utilities:** A collection of practical tools, including dual clocks and a currency converter.
