## 🌟 About

**Our Place** is a thoughtfully crafted web application designed as a _digital home_ for couples in long-distance relationships. Built with love (and React!), it offers a warm, unified environment where partners can leave notes, plan adventures, relive memories, and even watch videos in sync—all from their own cozy corners of the world.

Think of it as your apartment in the cloud, complete with a fridge, living room, window to the future, and more.
